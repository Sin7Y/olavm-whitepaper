\section{Integer Arithmetic Operations} \label{sec:integer-arithmetic-operation}

In order to support arithmetic operations of uint256 in OlaVM, we use two field elements to represent the lower and the upper 128 bits of a uint256 number. When describing the VM operating logic and constraints of an instruction, we use the following notations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|r_a|: Register \verb|a| which stores uint256 input $a$;
    \item \verb|r_a_lo|: Register \verb|a_lo| which stores the lower 128 bits of uint256 input $a$;
    \item \verb|r_a_hi|: Register \verb|a_hi| which stores the upper 128 bits of uint256 input $a$;
    \item \verb|r_b|: Register \verb|b| which stores another uint256 input $b$;
    \item \verb|r_b_lo|: Register \verb|b_lo| which stores the lower 128 bits of uint256 input $b$;
    \item \verb|r_b_hi|: Register \verb|b_hi| which stores the upper 128 bits of uint256 input $b$;
    \item \verb|r_dst|: Register \verb|dst| which stores the uint256 output;
    \item \verb|r_dst_lo|: Register \verb|dst_lo| which stores the lower 128 bits of uint256 operation output;
    \item \verb|r_dst_hi|: Register \verb|dst_hi| which stores the upper 128 bits of uint256 operation output;
    \item \verb|[r_x]|: The value of register \verb|x|;
    \item \verb|[carry_lo]|: The carry flag for lower 128-bit arithmetic operation;
    \item \verb|[carry_hi]|: The carry flag for upper 128-bit arithmetic operation;
    \item \verb|%{...%}|: Hints, a concept borrrowed from Cairo \cite{cryptoeprint:2021/1063}, which defines a block of some other programming language which will be executed by the prover right before the next instruction. This block is not implemented by OlaVM instructions.
