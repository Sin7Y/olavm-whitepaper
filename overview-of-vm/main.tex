\section{Overview of VM} \label{sec:overview-of-vm}

This section introduces the basic design ideas of OlaVM, primarily focusing on
(1) why we choose a register-based VM instead of a stack-based VM;
(2) how to design function calls on a register-based VM;
(3) defining VM instructions on a finite field for better proving efficiency;
(4) simplified VM instruction set design;
(5) structure description of the VM instructions.
