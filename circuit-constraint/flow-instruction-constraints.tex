\subsection{Flow Instruction Constraints}

\subsubsection{JMP}

\emph{Instruction:} \verb|JMP r_dst|

The VM logic is
\[ \texttt{pc = [r\_dst]} \]

The constraints are
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{pc}_{i+1} - \texttt{[r\_dst}_i\texttt{]} = 0, \\
    & \texttt{[r\_dst}_{i+1}\texttt{]} - \texttt{[r\_dst}_i\texttt{]} = 0.
\end{align*}

The value of other registers remain unchanged.

\subsubsection{CJMP}

\emph{Instruction:} \verb|CJMP r_dst|

The VM logic is
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{if [r\_flag] == 1} \\
    & \quad \texttt{pc = [r\_dst]} \\
    & \texttt{else} \\
    & \quad \texttt{pc = pc + 1}
\end{align*}

The constraints are
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{[r\_flag]}(\texttt{pc}_{i+1}-\texttt{[r\_dst}_i\texttt{]}) + (1 - \texttt{[r\_flag]})(\texttt{pc}_{i+1}-\texttt{pc}_i-1) = 0, \\

    & \texttt{[r\_flag}_{i+1}\texttt{]} = \texttt{[r\_flag}_i\texttt{]}.
\end{align*}

The value of other registers remain unchanged.

\subsubsection{CALL}

\emph{Instruction:} \verb|CALL r_dst|

The VM logic is
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{[fp] = pc + 1} \\
    & \texttt{fp = fp + 1} \\
    & \texttt{pc = [r\_dst]}
\end{align*}

The constraints are
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{[fp}_i\texttt{]} - (\texttt{pc}_i + 1) = 0, \\
    & \texttt{fp}_{i+1} - (\texttt{fp}_i + 1) = 0, \\
    & \texttt{pc}_{i+1} - \texttt{[r\_dst}_i\texttt{]} = 0, \\
    & \texttt{[r\_dst}_{i+1}\texttt{]} - \texttt{[r\_dst}_i\texttt{]} = 0.
\end{align*}

The value of other registers remain unchanged.

\subsubsection{RET}

\emph{Instruction:} \verb|RET|

The VM logic is
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{fp = fp - 1} \\
    & \texttt{pc = [fp]}
\end{align*}

The constraints are
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{fp}_{i+1} - (\texttt{fp}_i - 1) = 0, \\
    & \texttt{pc}_{i+1} - \texttt{[fp}_i\texttt{ - 1]} = 0.
\end{align*}

The value of other registers remain unchanged.

\subsubsection{END}

\emph{Instruction:} \verb|END|

The VM logic is
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{fp = 0} \\
    & \texttt{pc = 0} \\
    & \texttt{all registers set to 0}
\end{align*}

The constraints are
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{fp}_{i+1} = 0, \\
    & \texttt{pc}_{i+1} = 0, \\
    & \texttt{[r\_x}_{i+1}\texttt{]} = 0, \ x \in\{0, 1, 2, \ldots \}.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{MOV}

\emph{Instruction:} \verb|MOV r_dst, r_src|

The VM logic is
\[ \texttt{[r\_dst] = [r\_src]} \]

The constraints are
\begin{align*}
    & \texttt{[r\_src}_{i+1}\texttt{]} - \texttt{[r\_src}_i\texttt{]} = 0, \\
    & \texttt{[r\_dst}_{i+1}\texttt{]} - \texttt{[r\_src}_i\texttt{]} = 0.
\end{align*}

The value of other registers remain unchanged.

\subsubsection{MOVI}

\emph{Instruction:} \verb|MOVI r_dst, imm0|

The VM logic is
\[ \texttt{[r\_dst] = \texttt{imm0}} \]

The constraint is
\[ \texttt{[r\_dst}_{i+1}\texttt{]} = \texttt{imm0}. \]

The value of other registers remain unchanged.
