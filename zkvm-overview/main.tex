\section{Overview of ZKVM Architecture} \label{sec:overview-of-zkvm-architecture}

Our architectural approach is modular, designing the ZKVM to divide traces into main and sub traces. This section will describe the constraint list and consistency between main/sub traces, as well as between sub traces.
