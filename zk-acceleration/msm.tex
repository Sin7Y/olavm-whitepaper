\subsection{MSM of Variable Basis}

Given two vectors $(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$, $(G_1,G_2,\ldots,G_n)$, where $a_i$ is a field element, and $G_i$ is a point on the elliptic curve, MSM algorithm is to compute the following expressions: $\sum_{i=1}^n a_iG_i$.

\subsubsection{Windowing Method}

Assuming that the bit width of $a_i$ is $b$, we split it into multiple sub-modules with a bit width of $c$. Such sub-modules have a total of $k=\lceil b/c \rceil$, then
\[ a_iG_i = a_{i,0}G_i + 2^ca_{i,1}G_i + \cdots + 2^{(k-1)c}a_{i,k-1}G_i. \]
For all $i$ we have
\begin{align*}
    a_1G_1 &= a_{1,0}G_1 + 2^ca_{1,1}G_1 + \cdots + 2^{(k-1)c}a_{1,k-1}G_1, \\
    a_2G_2 &= a_{2,0}G_2 + 2^ca_{2,1}G_2 + \cdots + 2^{(k-1)c}a_{2,k-1}G_2, \\
    &\cdots \\
    a_nG_n &= a_{n,0}G_n + 2^ca_{n,1}G_n + \cdots + 2^{(k-1)c}a_{n,k-1}G_n.
\end{align*}
So
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_iG_i =\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} a_{i,j} 2^{jc} G_i
    =\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i,j} G_i\right) 2^{jc}.
\]
For $a_{i,j} \in [0,2^c)$, we can precompute
\[
    \begin{matrix}
        1G_1 & 2G_1 & \cdots & 2^{c-1}G_1 \\
        1G_2 & 2G_2 & \cdots & 2^{c-1}G_2 \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        1G_n & 2G_n & \cdots & 2^{c-1}G_n
    \end{matrix}
\]

\subsubsection{Endomorphism}

For a cyclic group $\mathbb{G}$ over an elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, if one can find such a group endomorphism $\varphi$:
there exists $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}_p$ such that $\varphi(x, y) = (\alpha x, \beta y)$ holds for all points on $\mathbb{G}$. It is easy to prove that such an automorphism is a multiplicative map, i.e.\ we can find a $\lambda$ such that $\varphi(P) = \lambda P$ holds for all points $P$ on $\mathbb{G}$. This means that when we know the coordinates of a point, we only need to multiply the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate by a number in $\mathbb{F}_p$ to become the coordinates of another point, which can be used for further optimization of the algorithm. If the parameters of the elliptic curve are special, for example, BLS curves can be written as $y^2 = x^3 + b$, and $p \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, taking an element $\alpha$ of order 3 in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$, there exits a corresponding $\lambda$ such that $\lambda (x, y) = (\alpha x, y)$, then the multiplication operation can be optimized as
\begin{align*}
    mP &= (m_1 + m_2\lambda)P \\
    &= m_1P + m_2(\lambda P) \\
    &= m_1P + m_2\varphi(P).
\end{align*}

From \cite{scq03} we can find small $m_1$ and $m_2$ to make the above equation hold, i.e.\ $|m_1|, |m_2| < \sqrt{3 \cdot |\mathbb{G}|}$, which can reduce a multiplication operation of $b$ bits into two multiplication operations of $b/2$ bits. Applied to the windowing method, the number of group operations is reduced to \[ \frac{b}{c}(n+2^c-2) + b-c+\frac{b}{c}-1 \approx \frac{b}{c}(n+2^c). \]
When $n = 10^5$, it can save about 5.5\% of group operations.
