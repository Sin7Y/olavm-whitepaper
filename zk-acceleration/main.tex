\section{ZK Acceleration} \label{sec:zk-acceleration}

The Zero Knowledge calculation process primarily consists of MSM, FFT/IFFT and polynomial evaluation. Given a circuit scale of approximately $2^{25}$, the rough computational consumption ratios are as shown in Figure \ref{fig:time-usage-origin}, ratios will vary for each unique scenario and algorithm.

    \caption{Consumption ratios of each module of ZK calculation when $n \approx 2^{25}$}
    \label{fig:time-usage-origin}
\end{figure}

Do note that with an increased circuit size, consumption ratio of FFT/IFFT increases as well (because of the better parallelism implementation of MSM than FFT/IFFT), therefore, simply accelerating MSM and FFT/IFFT modules by GPU/FPGA to improve the speed of the prover is limited. We need a ZK algorithm without FFT, where the proportion of FFT/IFFT is so small that it can be ignored, so that the final consumption ratio of each module is close to Figure \ref{fig:time-usage-without-fft}.

\end{figure}

We will introduce additional polynomials to eliminate FFT/IFFT calculations, thus generating additional MSM and polynomial evaluation operations, then using hardware-accelerated designs for MSM and polynomial evaluation operations.
