\subsection{Outline of the Paper}

The remaining sections of this paper are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Section \ref{sec:overview-of-vm} mainly describes the design of the virtual machine of OlaVM, which is the basis for OlaVM to obtain smaller execution traces and state transition constraints;
